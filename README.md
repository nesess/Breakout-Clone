# Breakout-Clone
A Breakout Clone game for school homework


Info:

This game made with Unity. This is not a complicated game if you watch the gameplay video you can understand game mechanichs. In the lesson, our teacher said that we should make at least two levels, but I did not like this idea. Therefore, I decided to make a system where you can play the game forever. Every time you cleared a level, a new level created with random block types and positions. So this way, trying to beat highscore is main pourpose and most fun part of this game. Finally I make this game in one day and all  visual and sound assets are not mine.
